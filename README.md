'''
An activation function in neural networks is a mathematical function applied to each neuron in a network to introduce non-linearity into the model. 
Without activation functions, a neural network would behave like a simple linear regression model regardless of its depth, as it would just be a combination of linear functions.

Activation functions determine the output of a neural network node based on its input, enabling the model to learn complex patterns and make decisions like classification or prediction
